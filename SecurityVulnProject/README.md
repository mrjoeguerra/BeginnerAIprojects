## Project Spotlight: Predicting Cybersecurity Vulnerability Severity with Machine Learning

What happens when you mix cybersecurity with machine learning? You get a project that not only flexes your technical muscles but also addresses a real-world problem: identifying and prioritizing software vulnerabilities before the bad guys do.

**The Challenge:**  
Software vulnerabilities are everywhere, but not all are created equal. Some are minor annoyances; others are ticking time bombs. My mission? Build an AI model that reads a vulnerability’s summary and predicts its severity, helping security teams focus on what matters most.

**The Journey:**

- **Data Wrangling:** I started with a real-world dataset of security vulnerabilities, rolled up my sleeves, and cleaned it for analysis—dropping missing values and focusing on the juicy bits: the vulnerability summaries and their severity ratings.
- **Feature Engineering:** Next, I transformed raw text into machine-readable features using TF-IDF vectorization, turning cybersecurity jargon into numbers the model could understand.
- **Model Building:** I trained a logistic regression classifier—a tried-and-true ML workhorse—on these features to predict severity levels (Low, Moderate, High, Critical).
- **Evaluation:** With precision, recall, and F1 scores in hand, I measured how well the model performed, then showcased predictions side-by-side with actual outcomes for transparency.
- **Interpretability:** To make it all digestible, I formatted outputs cleanly and explained what the model got right (and where it stumbled)—because in AI, results are only as good as your ability to communicate them.

**Skills Demonstrated:**

- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Natural language processing (NLP) for feature extraction
- Supervised ML model development and evaluation
- Clear, professional reporting and interpretability

**Why It Matters:**  
This project isn’t just about algorithms—it’s about using AI to make cybersecurity smarter, faster, and more proactive. It demonstrates my ability to take a messy, real-world problem from raw data to actionable insight, all while making the process transparent and accessible for both technical and non-technical audiences.
